Small Network Expanded – SSH
 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of secure remote management of network devices using SSH in a small enterprise network.
The objective was to ensure that only the ICT Manager (Admin PC) can securely access all network devices (switches, multilayer switch, and edge router) from a remote location.
The lab was designed and implemented using Cisco Packet Tracer, following CCNA best practices.
Objectives
Replace insecure Telnet with SSH
Configure a dedicated management VLAN
Restrict SSH access to a single authorized Admin PC
Apply ACLs to control remote access
Troubleshoot Layer 2, Layer 3, and OSPF issues
Validate end-to-end secure connectivity
Technologies & Concepts Used
Cisco IOS
SSH (Version 2)
VLANs & Management VLAN
Switch Virtual Interfaces (SVI)
Standard Access Control Lists (ACL)
OSPF Routing Protocol
Static IP Addressing
Network Troubleshooting
Network Topology
The network consists of:
Access Switches (HR, ICT, Sales, Server Room)
One Multilayer Switch (MLS)
One Edge Router
One Admin PC (ICT Manager)
Device hostnames were enabled for easier identification and management.
SECURE ACCESS DESIGN
Only the Admin PC is permitted to manage the network devices.
ADMIN PC CONFIGURATION
IP Address: 192.168.0.70/28
Default Gateway: 192.168.0.65
DNS Server: 8.8.8.8
KEY CONFIGURATIONS
1 SSH CONFIGURATION (ALL DEVICES)
hostname <DEVICE_NAME>
ip domain-name gtech.local
username Admin privilege 15 secret Admin123
crypto key generate rsa
ip ssh version 2
SSH ACL CONFIGS
ip access-list standard SSH-MGT
 permit host 192.168.0.70
 deny any

line vty 0 15
 login local
 transport input ssh
 access-class SSH-MGT in

MANAGEMENT VLAN
VLAN ID 99
VLAN name MGT
Subnet 192.168.0.64/28

MULTILAYER SWITCH(MLS) -MANAGEMENT SVI
interface vlan 99
 ip address 192.168.0.65 255.255.255.240
 no shutdown

ACCESS SWITCH MANAGEMENT CONFIGS
interface vlan 99
 ip address 192.168.0.66 255.255.255.240(192.168.0.67,192.168.0.68 and 192.168.0.69 )
 no shutdown
ip default-gateway 192.168.0.65
TESTING AND VERIFICATION
ssh -l admin 192.168.0.66   # HR Switch
ssh -l admin 192.168.0.67   # ICT Switch
ssh -l admin 192.168.0.68   # Sales Switch
ssh -l admin 192.168.0.69   # Server Room Switch
ssh -l admin 10.0.0.1       # MLS
ssh -l admin 10.0.0.2       # Edge Router
TROUBLESHOOTING SUMMARY
SSH failure on HR SW
- Cause: Incorrect VLAN assignment and conflicting ACL entries
- Fix: Removed unused VLAN and recreated the SSH ACL to permit only Admin PC
Unable to reach edge router
- Cause Management subnet 192.168.0.64/28 was no advertised in OSPF 
- Fix: Advertised the subnet under OSPF on the MLS
router ospf 1
 network 192.168.0.64 0.0.0.15 area 0

FINAL OUTCOME
Secure SSH access successfully configured on :
- All Access Switches
- Multilayer Switch
- Edge Router
Management Access restricted to one authorized host
Network fully reachable and securely manageable
SKILLS DEMONSTRATED
Secure device management using SSH
VLAN and SVI configuration
ACL implementation and troubleshooting
OSPF routing and subnet advertisement
